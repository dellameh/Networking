# Networking
This project works like malware. There is a multithreaded server that listens for incoming client connections over TCP. The server supports several operations such as:
1. Take screenshots from the client's screen.
2. Control the client's mouse.
3. Access the client's directory lists.
4. Transfer files from the client to the server.
